### Algorithm performance comparison 

In order to run the application please refer to the main method of the “Algorithms” class, it will run the performance comparison of the following 5 algorithms:
- Insertion sort: O(n2)
- Quick sort: O(n log n)
- Counting sort:  O(n + k )
- Merge sort: O(n log n)
- Introsort: O(n log n)

It will display a two-axis graph showing the input in its time response and it will show the results table on the console.
